# Analyse-AB-test-results
Workings to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website

The project is the statistics project done through Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. 
The project deals with the conversions and conversion rate for a website which has transitioned/ planning to transition to a new page of its website. 

The stats deals with the click though rate and deciphers that the statistical evidence suggests that the old page was better than the new page. 

This has been proved through AB testing and regression techniques.
